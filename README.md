## Course Synopsis

This course teaches the fundamentals of VueJS by building a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) website.

## Description

This tutorial provides an introduction to VueJS by building a website that manages a list of users. This type of site is called a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) application, as it provides the key functionality for interacting with a database.

This tutorial is primarily focused on teaching the fundamentals of VueJS by building an application.  This application does NOT use the Vue CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, but focuses on VueJS fundamentals through a standard web page.

The styling of this application is done using CSS and CSS Grid.  Iâ€™ll discuss a bit about the styling, but it is not the focus of the tutorial.  Additionally, the database that would typically be used for storing the data is being replaced by a web application (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) which provides a REST API for testing applications.
